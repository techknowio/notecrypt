#Notecrypt Client

Notecrypt is a very simple iPhone/Android Ionic App that is meant to be a replacement for Evernote, as I only use the basic features of
evernote, on all my devices, so the limitation of (2) devices that was announced today is a problem for me, and I assume other users.
Notecrypt is an encrypted note application, where the client encrypts the notes in AES256 and sends the notes to the server.

Enjoy fork, whatever.
